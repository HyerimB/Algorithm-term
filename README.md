# Huffman code-based program introduction
 
## (1) Windows Text Compression Program (.C)

A Windows desktop application designed to help users understand text compression through Huffman coding algorithm with a practical interface.

## Features
- Real-time text compression and decompression
- Visual display of compression results
- Compression ratio analysis
- User-friendly Windows interface

## How to Use
1. Enter text in the input field
2. Click 'Compress' to compress the text
3. View compression results and statistics
4. Use 'Decompress' to recover original text

## Tech Stack
- C/C++
- Win32 API
- Windows GUI Components

# (2) Java Huffman Chat Program (.java)

A network-based chat application that implements real-time message compression using Huffman coding algorithm, featuring both client and server components.

## Features
- Real-time message encoding/decoding
- Two-way communication system
- Visual display of encoded messages
- Compression-based data transfer

## How to Use
1. Start the server application
2. Launch client application
3. Enter messages to send
4. View both original and encoded messages

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Swing GUI
- Socket Programming
- Multi-threading
